linkedList is a data structure that contains a head, tail, and length property  (basically a list)
linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
compared to arrays, linked lists are good for insertion and deletion, but not good for random access (no index)
arrays are good for random access, but not good for insertion and deletion (shift, unshift, push, pop are O(n) time complexity)

example of a linked list:
head -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 2 -> null
tail -> 2 -> null
length -> 4
