//push and pop operations are always constant time O(1) because they only add or remove from the end of the array
//shift and unshift operations are always linear time O(n) because they add or remove from the beginning of the array
//splice operations are always linear time O(n) because they add or remove from the middle of the array
//concat operations are always linear time O(n) because they combine two arrays
//slice operations are always linear time O(n) because they copy an array
//sort operations are always O(nlogn) because they use divide and conquer algorithms to sort the array in O(nlogn) time complexity
