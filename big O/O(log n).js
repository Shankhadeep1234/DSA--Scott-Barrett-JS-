// Given a sorted array O(log n) is better than O(n) because it is faster to search through a sorted array
// divide and conquer algorithms are usually O(log n) because they divide the problem in half each time
// example of divide and conquer algorithm: binary search
// suppose you have a sorted array of numbers and you want to find the index of a particular number in the array
// you can use a divide and conquer algorithm to do this in O(log n) time
